# IPC deployment operations

This directory includes a set of scripts to ease the deployment of the IPC Solidity contracts to any network using hardhat.

-   `deploy.sh`: Deploys the IPC solidity contracts into a specific network.
-   `compile-abi.sh`: Compiles all contracts and outputs the ABI for the high-level contracts in the desired folder (by default `./out`).
