# Observability

## Overview

IPC's observability framework emits events throughout execution, which are recorded in a journal and transformed to Prometheus metrics.
This enables detailed monitoring and analysis of system behavior.
This is achieved through the use of the `ipc-observability` crate/library, which provides all the necessary helpers and tools to facilitate this process.

## Key features

1. **Events**: Specific events are defined and triggered throughout the codebase to capture significant occurrences or actions.
   These events encapsulate relevant data and context about what is happening within the system.

2. **Journal**: Events are recorded in a journal, which is a rotational ledger that records chronologically ordered, timestamped trace objects to log files on disk.
   The journal can also be emitted to console.

3. **Metrics**: Each event is associated with one or more Prometheus metrics.
   When an event is triggered, the corresponding metrics are updated to reflect the event's occurrence.
   This allows for real-time tracking and monitoring of various system activities and states through dashboards and alerts.

4. **Prometheus integration**: The metrics collected are designed to integrate seamlessly with Prometheus, a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit.
   Prometheus collects and stores these metrics, enabling detailed analysis and visualization through its query language and dashboarding capabilities.

5. **ipc-observability crate**: This custom library encapsulates the logic and functionality required to define, trigger, and record events and metrics.
   It simplifies the process of adding observability to the codebase by providing ready-to-use macros, structs, and functions.

## Configuration

### Metrics configuration

The metrics can be configured via the `config.toml` configuration file for Fendermint. You can enable metrics and specify the listening host and port as follows:

```toml
[metrics]
enabled = true

[metrics.listen]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 9184
```

For Ethereum metrics, you can configure them similarly:

```toml
[eth.metrics]
enabled = true
```

## Tracing and journal configuration

> 🚧 Note: the event journal and general logs are currently output to the same file.
> We plan to segregate in the near future so that the event journal has its dedicated file.
> See this issue: <https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/issues/1084>.

Tracing can also be configured via the configuration file for Fendermint. You can set the tracing level and specify whether to log to console or file.

### Console tracing

Example config:

```toml
[tracing]

[tracing.console]
level = "trace" # Eg. "info,my_crate::module=trace" - https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives
```

### File tracing

Example config:

```toml
[tracing.file]
enabled = true # Options: true, false
level = "trace" # Eg. "info,my_crate::module=trace" - https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives
directory = "/path/to/log/directory"
max_log_files = 5 # Number of files to keep after rotation
rotation = "daily" # Options: minutely, hourly, daily, never
## Optional: filter events by domain
domain_filter = ["Bottomup", "Consensus", "Mpool", "Execution", "Topdown", "System"]
## Optional: filter events by event name
events_filter = ["ParentFinalityAcquired", "ParentRpcCalled"]
```

By configuring these options, you can control the behavior of metrics and tracing, enabling fine-grained monitoring and logging for your application.
