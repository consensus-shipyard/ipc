# Fendermint

Fendermint is an effort to implement [IPC with Tendermint Core](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cFoTdoRuYgxmWJia6K-b5vmEj-4MvyHCNvShZpyconU/edit#). There is a preliminary [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVwkHEPGNg0js8DKRDIX7sugf5JqbI9zRBddIqzJFfI/edit#gid=0) that lays out the tasks towards implementing subnets that run IPLD and FVM under the Filecoin rootnet, sharing components with the Lotus/Eudico based implementation.
