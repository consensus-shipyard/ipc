### ⭐ HIGHLIGHT | Validator Gating 🌁🌉

The Validator Gater feature allows the interception of validator-related actions, such as staking, unstaking, and explicit validator membership adjustments (federated membership), based on user-defined policies. By implementing a custom smart contract that adheres to the `IValidatorGater` interface, developers can enforce custom logic to either permit or deny these actions.

This feature is designed to support both federated and collateral-based networks, providing flexibility to manage validator permissions and validator power assignments through an external gating contract.

### 🚀 Features

- _(contracts)_ Validator gating (#1127)

### 📚 Documentation

- _(docs)_ Validator gating docs (#1127)

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fixed typos (#1137)
- Fixed clippy (#1133)

## [axon-r03] - 2024-09-06

_Full changelog below._

### ⭐ HIGHLIGHT | Consistent Genesis 🧬🚀

The Consistent Genesis feature introduces an additional step of sealing the genesis, ensuring the inclusion of the genesis state, including both custom and built-in actors. This step prevents inconsistencies during node initialization. Previously, the genesis process required certain actors to be deployed at runtime when the node started, which could result in a panic and prevent the node from starting. With the Consistent Genesis update, actor code is directly incorporated into the genesis as part of the state tree, ensuring stability and consistency across all node starts.

### 🚀 Features

- _(node)_ Consistent Genesis (#1016)
- _(contracts)_ Improvements to contract deployment scripts (#1108)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- _(core)_ Set the default Fendermint log level to INFO (#1123)
- _(ci)_ CI speed-up improvements (#1124)

### 📚 Documentation

- _(docs)_ Moved documentation to monorepo (#1014)
- _(specs)_ Subnet Genesis v2 spec (#1113)
- _(node)_ Updated running docs with Consistent Genesis (#1128)

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fixed typos and updated dependencies (#1087, #1106, #1089)
- Fixed clippy/fmt and improved cache usage (#1125)
- Applied Prettier formatting to contracts (#1111)

## [axon-r02] - 2024-07-23

_Full changelog below._

### ⭐ HIGHLIGHTED | Observability Framework 👁️📊

- Introduced a new observability framework utilizing the `ipc-observability` crate.
  - This framework introduces events and metrics for detailed system monitoring and analysis.
  - Integrates with Prometheus for real-time tracking, alerting, and visualization.
  - Simplifies observability integration with ready-to-use macros, structs, and functions.

IPC now emits events during execution. These events are recorded in the Journal, and are transformed into Prometheus metrics. Observability configuration is performed via `config.toml`.

Refer to full observability documentation [here](./docs/fendermint/observability.md).

## [axon-r01] - 2024-07-15

### Introducing Axon

Hello World! It's early days for IPC. We are starting to enact a proper versioning and changelog practices. The framework will evolve rapidly in the next quarters, and it'll do so in major architectural milestones. With high probability, backwards compatibility between these milestones will **not** be preserved, requiring a manual migration to upgrade from one to the next. To cite a few such expected milestones: IPC modularization, consensus pluggability, Wasm-based client kernel.

We introduce the notion of "product generations" to represent the lifetime of IPC under each of these major architectural iterations. Product generations are named alphabetically A-Z (we certainly don't expect more than 26 generations...) We've kept the naming universe deliberately broad: entities/concepts found in biological, mathematical, or computing networks.

The first product generation is called **_Axon_**!

Find more background on these choices / implications here: https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/issues/1012.

### Axon r01

This is the baseline release of the IPC framework. A variation of this release is powering the networks of Fluence and Basin. Throughout the Axon generation, we do not expect to release crates and therefore we're staying away from adopting semver, resorting instead to simple sequential revision numbers. We're aiming to cut/tag revisions and publish changelogs on a weekly basis, with some flexibility to account for work in progress landing smoothly.

Axon r01 supports these major features (not a comprehensive list):

- CometBFT/Ignite-based consensus (currently on v0.37 but with plans to upgrade to [v0.38](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/pull/1004) / v1).
- Wasm- and IPLD-based Filecoin Virtual Machine as an execution layer, supporting custom built-in Wasm actors, custom syscalls, custom gas price lists, and more.
- Ethereum-compatible runtime and JSON-RPC API (quasi-Dencun level, missing [MCOPY](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/1025) support).
- Validator membership: federated (proof of authority) and collateral-driven (basis for proof of stake).
- Configurable supply source for subnets: either inheriting the parent root coin, or adopting an ERC20-compatible token for circulating supply / gas.
- L2 subnet creation, with L3+ behind a feature flag until we harden message propagation, response paths, and fault scenarios.
- Asynchronous general message passing across the IPC hierarchy, with result and return data delivery back to the caller.
- Cross-linked security: checkpointing on the parent via the relayer, and committing parent's finality in the subnet.
- Ability to permission and restrict contract deployment in subnets.
- Upgradability: framework actors can be upgraded through contract upgrades, and subnet hard forks can be run with the UpgradeScheduler.
- Validator management through the parent network.
- Automatic chain snapshots, with ability to bootstrap from them.
- Compatibility with the BlockScount explorer and Ethereum wallets out of the box.
- ... and a lot more.
