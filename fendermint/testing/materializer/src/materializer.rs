/// and accessible for the integration tests, carrying out the operations with
/// the help of the materializer, which should keep the [Testnet] itself testable.
///
/// The materializer might not actually instantiate the resources. By returning
/// abstract types instead of concrete values, it is possible to just collect the
/// operations and use them to validate the behaviour of whatever is driving
/// the materializer. We can use this for dry-runs as well.
///
/// A live materializer should persist its logs, so that it can be resumed.
/// For example we can create and run a testnet externally, then parse the manifest
/// and the materializer logs inside a test to talk to one of the nodes, and the
/// materializer should be able to return to the test correct JSON-RPC endpoints.
///
/// Some of the operations of the materializer should be idempotent, e.g. the
/// creation of a wallet or a node should only happen once.
///
/// The types returned might have their own logic to execute when dropped, to free
/// resources. This might happen only if the resource is not an externally managed
/// one, e.g. a testnet set up before tests are run, which the materializer should
/// know.
