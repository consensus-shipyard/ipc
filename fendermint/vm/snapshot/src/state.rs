        // the state root.

        // Inserting CIDs into the state store which did not exist in the original seem like a vector
        // of attack that could be used to cause consensus failure: if the attacker deployed a contract
        // that looked up a CID that validators who imported a snapshot have, but others don't, that
        // would cause a fork. However,  his is why the FVM doesn't currently allow the deployment of
        // user defined Wasm actors: the FEVM actors do not allow the lookup of arbitrary CIDs, so they
        // are safe, while Wasm actors with direct access to the IPLD SDK methods would be vulnerable.
        // Once the FVM implements the "reachability analysis" feature, it won't matter if we have an
        // extra record or not.
        //
        // Actually a very similar situation arises with garbage collection: since the length of history

        // configured their nodes, and cannot be allowed to cause a failure.
