# Performance Optimization Summary Card

## 🎯 Final Results

### Before → After
```
Block Time:    2.5s  →  0.69s   (3.6x faster) ⚡
Throughput:    24/m  →  90/m    (3.75x more) 🚀
Finality:      ~20s  →  ~7s     (2.8x faster) ⏱️
```

## ⚙️ Optimal Configuration

### Critical Settings (Validated)
```yaml
timeout_commit: "100ms"      # Block interval
timeout_propose: "400ms"     # ⭐ OPTIMAL (tested 300/400/500ms)
timeout_prevote: "200ms"     # Vote collection
timeout_precommit: "200ms"   # Commit time
```

### Cross-Chain
```yaml
polling_interval: 5s         # Parent chain checks (was: 10s)
chain_head_delay: 5 blocks   # Processing delay (was: 10)
vote_timeout: 30s            # Vote timeout (was: 60s)
```

## 📊 Test Results

| timeout_propose | Avg Block Time | Result |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 500ms | 0.68s | ✅ Good |
| **400ms** | **0.69s** | ✅ **OPTIMAL** ⭐ |
| 300ms | 0.76s | ❌ Too aggressive |

**Winner: 400ms** - Best balance of speed & stability

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Monitor performance
./ipc-manager watch-blocks

# Check parent finality
./ipc-manager watch-finality

# Full health check
./ipc-manager info

# Apply to new subnet
./ipc-manager init
```

## 📈 Performance Validation

### Healthy Metrics
✅ Block time: 0.6-0.8s average
✅ Fastest blocks: 0.4-0.5s
✅ No >2s blocks (no consensus failures)
✅ Parent finality advancing every ~10 blocks

### Warning Signs
⚠️ Average >1.0s
⚠️ Frequent >2s blocks
⚠️ Parent finality stalled

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **400ms is the sweet spot** for timeout_propose
2. **More aggressive ≠ faster** (300ms caused failures)
3. **Network quality matters** (<1ms latency enables this)
4. **~0.7s is near practical limit** (ABCI overhead dominates)
